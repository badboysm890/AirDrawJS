+ Thanks to mediaPipe The had a handtracking model for JS 
+ Used the handtracking to make sure we had coordinates
+ Used the coordinate distance to make a pattern and used as gesture
+ Finally the hard part we placed two canvas over another to while on makes detection and other makes drawing 
+ Simple as that


## Future Works

+ NPM package may be ?
+ And improved Gesture or Option to Choose Gesture
